# Zeppelin Solr Interpreter

* Interpreter built with Apache Solr as backend and allows user to issue Solr queries and display results in the Zeppelin UI

### Installation
1. Download and untar [Apache Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org/download.html) distribution if you don't have it already (Go lite or all)
2. Install this interpreter via command

```apple js
./bin/install-interpreter.sh --name solr --artifact com.lucidworks.zeppelin:zeppelin-solr:0.1.6
```

After running the above command

1. Restart Zeppelin

2. On the Interpreters page configure the 'solr' interpreter to point to a Solr base Url and default collection. Default
JDBC parameters can also be set for use the with the "jdbc" Streaming Expression. The JDBC parameters will be
automatically added to out-going jdbc calls if the jdbc Streaming Expression does not specify the connection parameters.

3. Create a notebook with the default interpreter set to Solr.

Commands:

#### help
Display help text in the note window. Command-specific help is provided if a valid command is provided as an argument.

Usage: `help [{specific-command}]`

#### use
Set a collection to use in the notebook.

Usage: `use {collection_name}`

#### search
Issue a search query and have the results displayed as table, collection param can be passed in here avoiding `use {collection_name}`

Usage: `search {query-params}`

#### facet
Issue a query with facet fields and display the facet counts. No need to explicitly add `facet=true` for these queries, collection param can be passed in here avoiding `use {collection_name}`

Usage: `facet {facet-params}`

#### stream
Issue a streaming expression query and display the output as a table (No prefix required)

Usage: `{stream-expr}`

#### sql
Issue an Solr SQL query and display the results as a table (No prefix required)

Usage: `{sql-string}`

### Troubleshooting

* Check Solr interpreter log for any Solr errors (logs/zeppelin-interpreter-solr-\*) (Fixed in 0.1.1)
* Zeppelin 0.8.0 does not work well if interpreter does not have the same name as the interpreter installed. Not sure what is causing this. I would recommend using `solr` for interpreter name
* If you have already installed a previous version of this interpreter, you will need to rename the `./interpreter/solr` directory to allow the installer to run.
